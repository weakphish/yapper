# Yapper

## Yet Another Powerful Productivity Engine, Redux

## What?

- a task management/note-taking application solving the needs that I have and
  haven't been able to find in other
  software
- Like HeyNote, but with persistent tasks and tag view pages
  - dump info in, let organization evolve organically
  - tasks as first-class citizens
  - zoomable blocks, infinitely nested as a tree representation
  - custom types represented by a tag's page

## Future Wishlist

- [ ] Plugins
  - Lua? PyO3?
- [ ] Vim bindings
  - [ ] Embed Neovim?
