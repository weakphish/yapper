# Yapper

## Yet Another Powerful Productivity Engine, Redux

## What?

- a task management/note-taking application solving the needs that I have and
  haven't been able to find in other
  software
- dump info in, let organization evolve organically
- tasks as first-class citizens
- custom types represented by a tag's page
- all markdown

## File Storage
Stored in a directory with folders for tasks and notes, in plain markdown

### CLI
- CLI to:
  - add a note with $EDITOR
  - add a task
  - open TUI

- TUI to:
  - view your tasks 
  - view your notes
  - edit tasks/notes
    - add dependencies
    - change start/end date
    - add tags

## Future Wishlist
