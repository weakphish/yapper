# Yapper

## Yet Another Powerful Productivity Engine, in Rust.

## What?

- a task management/note-taking application solving the needs that I have and haven't been able to find in other
  software
- dump info in, let organization evolve organically
- tasks as first-class citizens
- custom types represented by a tag's page

## Design Notes

- Two main 'screens':
    - Main view - all blocks in order of most recent first
        - Sub(?) view for editing / adding a block
    - Tag view - view all blocks/tasks with a given tag

## Future Wishlist

- [ ] Plugins
    - Lua?
- [ ] Vim bindings
    - [ ] Embed Neovim?
