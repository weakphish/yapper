# Yapper

## Yet Another Powerful Productivity Engine, in ~~Rust~~ Go?.

## What?

- a task management/note-taking application solving the needs that I have and haven't been able to find in other
  software
- dump info in, let organization evolve organically
- tasks as first-class citizens
- zoomable blocks, infinitely nested as a tree representation
- custom types represented by a tag's page

## Roadmap

### Core

- [x] Core data structures
- [ ] Daily Page
- [ ] Tag page (default type)
- [ ] Backlinks between blocks
- [ ] User input on block
- [ ] Parse and store data
- [ ] Define API for front-ends

### TUI

- [ ] Render a basic "daily" page for dumping as a tree

### Future Wishlist

- [ ] Plugins
  - Lua?
- [ ] Vim bindings
  - [ ] Embed Neovim?
